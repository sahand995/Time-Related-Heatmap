# Time-Related Crowd Occupancy Heat-map:
Using a customized C# algorithm, I have developed a Time-Related Heat-map that plots the movement and occupancy concentration of any moving object on a 2D surface plain. The tool can be used for various use cases such as visualizing and tracking workersâ€™ location, as well as the high occupancy pin points in a construction site.
