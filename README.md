# Time Related Heatmap
I have developed a Time-Related Heatmap using a customized C# algorithm in the Unity, tracking laborsâ€™ location.

## How to Use
After running it in Unity

### First Labor
* If you press **Up Arrow Key** on your keyboard, the labor move forward.
* If you press **Left Arrow Key** and **Right Arrow Key** on your keyboard, the labor trun left and turn right respectively.

### Second Labor
* If you press **W** on your keyboard, the labor move forward.
* If you press **A** and **D** on your keyboard, the labor trun left and turn right respectively.
